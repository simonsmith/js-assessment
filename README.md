# A test-driven JS assessment

My attempts at solving these exercises.

See the [original repo](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment)

#### Running it

*Tests will only work in a decent ES6 compatible browser, like Chrome*

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).
